    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: April 14, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to providing a transparent approach to user data. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when using our application.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Advertising</h2>
    <p>Our application integrates InMobi to display advertisements. While we do not directly collect user data, InMobi may collect and process certain information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system, advertising ID)</li>
      <li>IP address (used for location-based ad targeting)</li>
      <li>App usage data and interactions with ads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data collection is handled by InMobi and is subject to InMobi's Privacy Policy and terms of service.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Since our application integrates InMobi, third-party services may collect user data for advertising purposes. This may include personalized and non-personalized ads, depending on the user's preferences and location.</p>
    <p>Users within the European Economic Area (EEA) and other regulated regions will have the option to manage their ad preferences in compliance with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).</p>

    <h2>4. User Consent</h2>
    <p>For users in regions requiring explicit consent (such as the EEA under GDPR), our application will prompt users to opt in or opt out of personalized ads. If users decline personalized ads, only non-personalized ads will be displayed.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any data processed within our application. However, since ad-related data is managed by InMobi, we encourage users to review InMobi’s privacy settings and security practices for additional control.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our application is not directed towards children under the age of 13. If the app is categorized as a child-directed service under applicable policies, we will ensure compliance with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) by disabling personalized ads for minors.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about any modifications.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at: <strong>fifteenthirtythree2025@gmail.com</strong></p>
